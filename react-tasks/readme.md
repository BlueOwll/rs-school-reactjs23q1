for cross-check:
1. checkout to the branch *react-ssr*
2. open dir *react-tasks*
3. rename file `.env.example` to `.env` - getting code from flickr quite tricky
4. run script `npm run build` for building both clent and server projects
5. run script `npm run start` for starting server 
6. open your browser and find the website at *localhost:5173*    
7. run script `npm run cypress:test`    for e2e tests
8. run script `npm run cypress:coverage`    for checkin test coverage

other scripts
